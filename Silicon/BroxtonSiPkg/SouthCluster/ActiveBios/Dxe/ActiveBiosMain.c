  <b>ActiveBios DXE Module Entry Point</b>\n
  - <b>Introduction</b>\n
    The ActiveBios module is a DXE driver that provides the capability of switching
    the PCH mapping of the memory range from 4 GB - 16 MB to 4 GB to different devices.
    The current code supports mapping the range to LPC/eSPi and SPI.

  - <b>Details</b>\n
    This module is required if you want to support mapping BIOS address space to different
    buses: LPC/eSPI or SPI. The protocol produced by this module allows code to easily switch
    the BIOS mapping. For example: to switch between SPI and FWH if the platform supports both.
      - @note If you do not utilize this module, it may be necessary to modify existing FWH or
        SPI drivers and utilities to remove dependencies on the EFI_ACTIVE_BIOS_PROTOCOL protocol.

  - @pre
    PCH PCR base address configured

  - @result
    The ActiveBios driver produces the EFI_ACTIVE_BIOS_PROTOCOL

  - <b>Integration Checklists</b>\n
    - Verify prerequisites are met
    - Add ActiveBios\Dxe\ActiveBios.inf to the platform DSC file.

  - <b>Porting Recommendations</b>\n
    Any modification of this module should be done in compliance with the EFI_ACTIVE_BIOS_PROTOCOL protocol definition.
    For some platforms, it may be desirable to add support for PCI BIOS mapping.
    It is unlikely that this module will vary much between PCH generations. It may be desirable
    to port to a single module that supports multiple PCH generations to enable more code sharing.
